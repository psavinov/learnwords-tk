LearnWords in Perl/Tk
=====================

Simple application to learn foreign words in the very simple and fast way.
First of all, you have to fulfill your dictionary with "Add word" button, application will show you 20 words per page. Then, you can hide right part (with translation) and try to remember the translation of each word in the left part, after that, repeat the procedure with the right part.
If you want to learn the words, just show both parts!

Any comments/fixes/improvements are welcome!

Enjoy.

ps: Tk used to make a GUI, you have to install it first, if you still don't have it installed ;)
